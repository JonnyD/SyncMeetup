# SyncMeetup

(Work in progress). 

Sync Meetup events into your Google calendar. 

By default Meetup.com only offers you the option to sync RSVP events to your calendar but this will allow you to sync all events from the groups you are a member of so you can always keep up to date without having to remember to constantly visit Meetup.com.
